## Phase 10: Deployment and Maintenance (DEPLOY-010)

**Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Deployment to Static Hosting:** Deploy the PWA to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3).
2.  **HTTPS Configuration:** Ensure HTTPS is properly configured and enforced for the deployed application.
3.  **Domain Name Setup:** Set up a custom domain name for the PWA (if required).
4.  **Service Worker Deployment:** Deploy the service worker to enable PWA offline capabilities in the deployed application.
5.  **Performance Monitoring Integration (Production):** Integrate performance monitoring tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry Performance) for production performance tracking.
6.  **Error Reporting Integration (Production):** Integrate error reporting service (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag) to capture and track production errors.
7.  **Maintenance Plan:** Define a basic maintenance plan for ongoing updates, bug fixes, security patches, and monitoring of the deployed application.
8.  **Deployment Documentation:** Document the deployment process, configuration steps, and maintenance procedures.

**Edge Cases:**

1.  **Deployment Failures:** Handle deployment failures due to configuration issues, network problems, or hosting service errors.
2.  **HTTPS Configuration Errors:** Resolve issues with HTTPS setup and ensure secure communication for the deployed application.
3.  **Domain Name Propagation Issues:** Handle DNS propagation delays or domain configuration errors.
4.  **Service Worker Deployment Problems:** Ensure the service worker is correctly deployed and activated in the production environment.
5.  **Performance Monitoring Setup Errors:** Troubleshoot issues with performance monitoring integration and data collection.
6.  **Error Reporting Integration Failures:** Resolve problems with error reporting setup and ensure errors are captured in production.
7.  **Maintenance Plan Inadequacy:** Develop a maintenance plan that is comprehensive and addresses key maintenance aspects.
8.  **Documentation Gaps in Deployment Process:** Ensure deployment documentation is complete, accurate, and easy to follow.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Deploy the PWA to a static hosting service.**
2.  **Ensure HTTPS and service worker are deployed and configured.**
3.  **Integrate performance and error monitoring for production.**
4.  **Define a maintenance plan and document deployment process.**

    # Deployment Documentation - Mind Map PWA

    **Project:** Mind Map PWA
    **Phase:** Phase 10: Deployment and Maintenance (DEPLOY-010)
    **Date:** [Date of Documentation Generation]
    **Prepared by:** [Your Name/Team]

    ## 1. Introduction
    This document provides a step-by-step guide for deploying the Mind Map PWA application to a static hosting service.

    ## 2. Prerequisites
    - Static hosting account (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3).
    - Netlify CLI installed (if deploying to Netlify - adjust for other hosting).
    - Domain name (optional - if setting up custom domain).

    ## 3. Deployment Steps
    1.  **Build the application for production:**
        \`\`\`bash
        npm run build
        \`\`\`
        - This command will create a production-ready build in the \`dist\` folder.
    2.  **Deploy to static hosting (example: Netlify CLI):**
        \`\`\`bash
        netlify deploy --prod
        \`\`\`
        - [Adjust command if using other hosting CLI or deployment method]
        - Follow the prompts from the hosting CLI to deploy the \`dist\` folder to your hosting account.
    3.  **Verify HTTPS deployment:**
        - Access the deployed application URL in a browser.
        - Check for the HTTPS lock icon in the address bar to ensure secure connection.
        - You can also use online SSL checker tools to verify SSL certificate.
    4.  **Set up custom domain name (optional):**
        - If using a custom domain, configure it through your hosting provider's dashboard and domain registrar.
        - Point your domain's DNS records to your hosting provider's servers as instructed by your provider.
        - Wait for DNS propagation (may take some time).
        - Verify custom domain is working correctly and HTTPS is enabled for the custom domain.
    5.  **Verify service worker deployment:**
        - Access the deployed application in a browser.
        - Open browser DevTools (Application -> Service Workers).
        - Check if the service worker is registered and active.
        - Test offline functionality by disconnecting from the internet and reloading the application.
    6.  **Integrate production performance monitoring:**
        - [Follow instructions for your chosen performance monitoring tool (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry Performance)]
        - Add tracking scripts or SDK initialization code to your application (e.g., in \`index.html\` or \`src/index.tsx\`).
        - Configure performance metrics and dashboards in your monitoring tool.
    7.  **Integrate production error reporting:**
        - [Follow instructions for your chosen error reporting service (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag)]
        - Install error reporting SDK (e.g., \`@sentry/react\`) and initialize it in your application (\`src/index.tsx\`) with your project DSN.
        - Configure error reporting settings and alerts in your error reporting service.

    ## 4. Rollback Procedure (if needed)
    [Define a basic rollback procedure in case of deployment issues - depends on hosting provider]
    - [Example for Netlify: Revert to previous deploy version using Netlify UI or CLI]
    - [For other hosting providers, describe how to revert to a previous deployment state]

    ## 5. Maintenance Procedures
    - Refer to the [Maintenance Plan](docs/MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md) for ongoing maintenance procedures.
