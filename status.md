## 2023-04-01: Implemented IndexedDB for All Brainstorming Data

### Feature: IndexedDB Storage

- **Changes**:
  - Created a comprehensive IndexedDB schema with stores for:
    - `mindMaps`: Stores mind map data
    - `offlineOperations`: Stores operations for offline sync
    - `settings`: Stores user preferences (theme, accessibility, locale)
    - `appState`: Stores application state (drawer open/closed, tab selection)
    - `chatHistory`: Stores chat messages and history
  - Implemented services for each data type:
    - `settingsService.ts`: Manages theme, accessibility, and locale settings
    - `appStateService.ts`: Manages application state
    - `chatHistoryService.ts`: Manages chat history
  - Created migration utility to move data from localStorage to IndexedDB
  - Updated all contexts to use IndexedDB with localStorage fallback
  - Added error handling and graceful degradation when IndexedDB is not available
  - Added tests for IndexedDB services and migration utilities

- **Benefits**:
  - Improved data persistence across browser sessions
  - Better offline support for all application data
  - More structured and organized data storage
  - Improved performance for large datasets
  - Better support for complex data structures
  - Reduced localStorage usage (which has size limitations)

- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement data synchronization between IndexedDB and S3
  - Add data compression for large datasets
  - Implement data versioning and conflict resolution
  - Add data encryption for sensitive information
