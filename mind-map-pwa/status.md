## Bug Fixes

### 2025-04-01: Fixed Context Provider Order Issue

**Issue:** The application was throwing an error "useI18n must be used within an I18nContextProvider" because the ErrorNotificationContextProvider was trying to use the useI18n hook but was rendered before the I18nContextProvider.

**Changes:**
- Reordered the context providers in main.tsx to ensure I18nContextProvider wraps ErrorNotificationContextProvider
- This ensures that the useI18n hook is available to the ErrorNotificationContextProvider

**Files Modified:**
- src/main.tsx

### 2025-04-01: Fixed AWS SDK Browser Compatibility Issues

**Issue:** The AWS SDK was causing "Uncaught ReferenceError: global is not defined" in the browser environment, and S3 functionality was not properly optional.

**Changes:**
- Created a global polyfill utility to ensure Node.js globals are available in the browser
- Implemented dynamic imports for AWS SDK to improve loading performance
- Made S3 functionality truly optional with proper fallbacks
- Improved error handling for cases when S3 is not available
- Restructured S3 service initialization to be asynchronous
- Added proper checks before attempting to use S3 functionality

**Files Modified:**
- src/services/s3SyncService.ts
- src/services/s3Service.ts
- src/main.tsx
- Added new file: src/utils/globalPolyfill.ts

### 2025-04-01: Fixed S3SyncService Export Error

**Issue:** The s3SyncService.ts file had export statements inside a conditional block, which is not allowed in JavaScript/TypeScript.

**Changes:**
- Restructured the s3SyncService.ts file to move export statements outside of the conditional block
- Created function declarations outside the conditional block
- Implemented the functions conditionally inside the file
- Added proper null checks for S3 service when it's not enabled
- Improved error handling for cases when S3 is not available

**Files Modified:**
- src/services/s3SyncService.ts
