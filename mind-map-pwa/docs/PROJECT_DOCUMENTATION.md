1. Create a new site in Netlify
2. Connect to your Git repository
3. Set build command to `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory to `dist`
5. Configure environment variables for S3 credentials
6. Deploy the site

#### Vercel
1. Create a new project in Vercel
2. Connect to your Git repository
3. Set build command to `npm run build`
4. Set output directory to `dist`
5. Configure environment variables for S3 credentials
6. Deploy the project

#### AWS S3 + CloudFront
1. Create an S3 bucket for static website hosting
2. Build the application with `npm run build`
3. Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to the S3 bucket
4. Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket
5. Configure HTTPS and custom domain if needed

### Post-Deployment Steps
1. Verify the application works correctly in production
2. Test offline functionality
3. Verify service worker registration
4. Test synchronization with S3
5. Check performance and accessibility in production

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Development Server Issues
- **Problem**: Vite development server fails to start
- **Solution**: Check for port conflicts, restart terminal, or check Vite configuration

#### S3 Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Cannot connect to S3 bucket
- **Solution**: Verify S3 credentials in `.env` file, check network connectivity, ensure bucket exists and is accessible

#### IndexedDB Issues
- **Problem**: IndexedDB operations fail
- **Solution**: Check browser support, verify database schema, check for storage quota issues

#### Service Worker Issues
- **Problem**: Service worker not registering or updating
- **Solution**: Check service worker registration in browser DevTools, clear browser cache, verify service worker code

#### Offline Mode Issues
- **Problem**: Application doesn't work offline
- **Solution**: Verify service worker is active, check cache storage, ensure offline fallbacks are implemented

#### Synchronization Issues
- **Problem**: Data not synchronizing with S3
- **Solution**: Check network connectivity, verify S3 credentials, check for conflicts in data

### Debugging Tools
- Browser DevTools (Application tab for IndexedDB and Service Worker)
- React DevTools for component debugging
- Performance monitoring tools in the application
- Error logs in browser console
